## HipChat OS X App Install

Intended for automated deployment of the HipChat OS X app in enterprise environments.

This script will download an archive containing the latest HipChat app that Atlassian is serving for OS X, copy it to the /Applications directory, and correct permissions.

If HipChat is running when the script does, it will not continue.
